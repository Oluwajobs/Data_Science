# Data_Science
I've just began my data science journey and I look forward to doing a great lot. So help me God! 

Hello here!

I am learning python and python for Data Science.
I have finished my introductory course on python and I am working on using NumPy and Pandas now

I commit to learning pandas fully.
I started a new course with IBM, I think it will be fun and You will be here to guide me.
